v0.4.1-dev
 * EMR runner throws IOError if output path already exists (#634)

v0.4, 2013-04-30 -- Slouching toward nirvana
 * Changes:
   * 'mrjob' command (#225)
   * Changed default runner from 'local' to 'inline' (#423)
   * Local runner no longer adds working directory to PYTHONPATH of
     subprocesses; use inline runner instead (#424)
   * Requires boto 2.2.0 or later

     but forwarded from runners for backward compatibility
   * Changed exception hierarchy of mrjob.ssh (which is private but
     important)
   * Inline and local runners now inherit from the SimMRJobRunner class and thus share most
     of their implementation
   * Internal data structure for representing a step is much richer, allowing
     many cool future features (#479)
   * mrjob detects Hadoop version from EMR based on API responses instead of
     what's in the config (#611)
 * New features:
   * Support for non-Hadoop Streaming jar steps (#499)
   * Support for arbitrary commands as Hadoop Streaming
     mappers/combiners/reducers
   * mapper_pre_filter, combiner_pre_filter, and reducer_pre_filter allow
     running of a UNIX command in front of tasks to filter input outside of
     the interpreter
   * Hadoop runner uses PTY to print output from the Hadoop sub process to the
     console (#580)
   * mrjob knows how to terminate the job on cleanup (Ctrl+C closes the job).
     (#353)
   * Allow use of multiple -c flags on the command line (#420)
 * Bug fixes:
   * Silenced some incorrect warnings about ignored options in 'inline' runner
