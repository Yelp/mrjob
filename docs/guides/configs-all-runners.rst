Options available to all runners
================================

The format of each item in this document is:

.. mrjob-opt::
    :config: mrjob_conf_option_name
    :switch: --command-line-option-name
    :type: option_type
    :set: none
    :default: default value

    Description of option behavior

Options that take multiple values can be passed multiple times on the command
line. All options can be passed as keyword arguments to the runner if
initialized programmatically.

.. _configs-making-files-available:

Making files available to tasks
-------------------------------

Most jobs have dependencies of some sort - Python packages, Debian packages,
data files, etc. This section covers options available to all runners that
mrjob uses to upload files to your job's execution environments. See
:ref:`writing-file-options` if you want to write your own command line
options related to file uploading.

.. warning::

    You **must** wait to read files until **after class initialization**. That
    means you should use the :ref:`*_init() <single-step-method-names>` methods
    to read files. Trying to read files into class variables will not work.

.. mrjob-opt::
    :config: bootstrap_mrjob
    :switch: --bootstrap-mrjob, --no-bootstrap-mrjob
    :type: boolean
    :set: all
    :default: ``True``

    Should we automatically tar up the mrjob library and install it when we run
    job?  Set this to ``False`` if you've already installed ``mrjob`` on your
    Hadoop cluster or install it by some other method.

.. mrjob-opt::
    :config: upload_files
    :switch: --file
    :type: :ref:`path list <data-type-path-list>`
    :set: all
    :default: ``[]``

    Files to copy to the local directory of the mr_job script when it runs. You
    can set the local name of the dir we unpack into by appending
    ``#localname`` to the path; otherwise we just use the name of the file.

    In the config file::

        upload_files:
          - file_1.txt
          - file_2.sqlite

    On the command line::

        --file file_1.txt --file file_2.sqlite

.. mrjob-opt::
    :config: upload_archives
    :switch: --archive
    :type: :ref:`path list <data-type-path-list>`
    :set: all
    :default: ``[]``

    A list of archives (e.g. tarballs) to unpack in the local directory of the
    mr_job script when it runs. You can set the local name of the dir we unpack
    into by appending ``#localname`` to the path; otherwise we just use the
    name of the archive file (e.g. ``foo.tar.gz`` is unpacked to the directory
    ``foo.tar.gz/``, and ``foo.tar.gz#stuff`` is unpacked to the directory
    ``stuff/``).

.. mrjob-opt::
    :config: python_archives
    :switch: --python-archive
    :type: :ref:`path list <data-type-path-list>`
    :set: all
    :default: ``[]``

    Same as upload_archives, except they get added to the job's
    :envvar:`PYTHONPATH`.

Temp files and cleanup
----------------------

.. mrjob-opt::
    :config: base_tmp_dir
    :switch: --base-tmp-dir
    :type: :ref:`path <data-type-path>`
    :set: all
    :default: value of :py:func:`tempfile.gettempdir`

    Path to put local temp dirs inside.

.. _configs-all-runners-cleanup:

.. mrjob-opt::
   :config: cleanup
   :switch: --cleanup
   :type: :ref:`string <data-type-string>`
   :set: all
   :default: ``'ALL'``

    List of which kinds of directories to delete when a job succeeds. Valid
    choices are:

    * ``'ALL'``: delete local scratch, remote scratch, and logs; stop job flow
        if on EMR and the job is not done when cleanup is run.
    * ``'LOCAL_SCRATCH'``: delete local scratch only
    * ``'LOGS'``: delete logs only
    * ``'NONE'``: delete nothing
    * ``'REMOTE_SCRATCH'``: delete remote scratch only
    * ``'SCRATCH'``: delete local and remote scratch, but not logs
    * ``'JOB'``: stop job if on EMR and the job is not done when cleanup runs
    * ``'JOB_FLOW'``: terminate the job flow if on EMR and the job is not done
        on cleanup
    * ``'IF_SUCCESSFUL'`` (deprecated): same as ``ALL``. Not supported for
        ``cleanup_on_failure``.

    In the config file::

        cleanup: [LOGS, JOB]

    On the command line::

        --cleanup=LOGS,JOB

.. mrjob-opt::
   :config: cleanup_on_failure
   :switch: --cleanup-on-failure
   :type: :ref:`string <data-type-string>`
   :set: all
   :default: ``'NONE'``

    Which kinds of directories to clean up when a job fails. Valid choices are
    the same as **cleanup**.

.. mrjob-opt::
   :config: output_dir
   :switch: --output-dir
   :type: :ref:`string <data-type-string>`
   :set: no_mrjob_conf
   :default: (automatic)

    An empty/non-existent directory where Hadoop streaming should put the
    final output from the job.  If you don't specify an output directory,
    we'll output into a subdirectory of this job's temporary directory. You
    can control this from the command line with ``--output-dir``. This option
    cannot be set from configuration files. If used with the ``hadoop`` runner,
    this path does not need to be fully qualified with ``hdfs://`` URIs
    because it's understood that it has to be on HDFS.

.. mrjob-opt::
    :config: no_output
    :switch: --no-output
    :type: boolean
    :set: no_mrjob_conf
    :default: ``False``

    Don't stream output to STDOUT after job completion.  This is often used in
    conjunction with ``--output-dir`` to store output only in HDFS or S3.

Job execution context
---------------------

.. mrjob-opt::
    :config: cmdenv
    :switch: --cmdenv
    :type: :ref:`environment variable dict <data-type-env-dict>`
    :set: all
    :default: ``{}``

    Dictionary of environment variables to pass to the job inside Hadoop
    streaming.

    In the config file::

        cmdenv:
            PYTHONPATH: $HOME/stuff
            TZ: America/Los_Angeles

    On the command line::

        --cmdenv PYTHONPATH=$HOME/stuff,TZ=America/Los_Angeles

.. mrjob-opt::
    :config: interpreter
    :switch: --interpreter
    :type: :ref:`string <data-type-string>`
    :set: all
    :default: value of :mrjob-opt:`python_bin` (``'python'``)

    Interpreter to launch your script with. Defaults to the value of
    **python_bin**, which is deprecated. Change this if you're using a
    language besides Python 2.5-2.7.

.. mrjob-opt::
    :config: python_bin
    :switch: --python-bin
    :type: :ref:`command <data-type-command>`
    :set: all
    :default: ``'python'``

    Deprecated (use :mrjob-opt:`interpreter` instead). Name/path of alternate
    Python binary for wrapper scripts and mappers/reducers.

.. mrjob-opt::
    :config: setup
    :switch: --setup
    :type: :ref:`string list <data-type-string-list>`
    :set: all
    :default: ``[]``

    A list of lines of shell script to run before each task (mapper/reducer).

    This option is complex and powerful; the best way to get started is to
    read the :doc:`setup-cookbook`.

    Using this option replaces your task with a shell "wrapper" script that
    executes the setup commands, and then executes the task as the last line
    of the script. This means that environment variables set by hadoop
    (e.g. ``$mapred_job_id``) are available to setup commands, and that you
    can pass environment variables to the task (e.g. ``$PYTHONPATH``) using
    ``export``.

    We use file locking around the setup commands (not the task)
    to ensure that multiple tasks running on the same node won't run them
    simultaneously (it's safe to run ``make``). Before running the task,
    we ``cd`` back to the original working directory.

    In addition, passing expressions like ``path#name`` will cause
    *path* to be automatically uploaded to the task's working directory
    with the filename *name*, marked as executable, and interpolated into the
    script by its absolute path on the machine running the script.

    *path* may also be a URI, and ``~`` and environment variables within *path*
    will be resolved based on the local environment. *name* is optional.
    You can indicate that an archive should be unarchived into a directory by
    putting a ``/`` after *name*. For details of parsing, see
    :py:func:`~mrjob.setup.parse_setup_cmd`.

.. mrjob-opt::
    :config: setup_cmds
    :switch: --setup_cmd
    :type: :ref:`string list <data-type-string-list>`
    :set: all
    :default: ``[]``

    .. deprecated:: 0.4.2

    A list of commands to run before each mapper/reducer step. Basically
    :mrjob-opt:`setup` without automatic file uploading/interpolation.
    Can also take commands as lists of arguments.

.. mrjob-opt::
    :config: setup_scripts
    :switch: --setup-script
    :type: :ref:`path list <data-type-path-list>`
    :set: all
    :default: ``[]``

    .. deprecated:: 0.4.2

    Files that will be copied into the local working directory and then run.

    Pass ``'path/to/script#'`` to :mrjob-opt:`setup` instead.

.. mrjob-opt::
    :config: sh_bin
    :switch: --sh-bin
    :type: :ref:`command <data-type-command>`
    :set: all
    :default: :command:`sh -e` (:command:`/bin/sh -e` on EMR)

    Name/path of alternate shell binary to use for :mrjob-opt:`setup` and
    :mrjob-opt:`bootstrap`. Needs to be backwards compatible with
    Bourne Shell (e.g. ``'bash'``).

    To force setup/bootstrapping to terminate when any command exits with
    an error, use ``'sh -e'``.

.. mrjob-opt::
    :config: steps_python_bin
    :switch: --steps-python-bin
    :type: :ref:`command <data-type-command>`
    :set: all
    :default: current Python interpreter

    Name/path of alternate python binary to use to query the job about its
    steps. Rarely needed. Defaults to ``sys.executable`` (the current Python
    interpreter).

.. mrjob-opt::
    :config: strict_protocols
    :switch: --strict-protocols, --no-strict-protocols
    :type: boolean
    :set: all
    :default: ``None``

    If this is true, the job will raise an exception when encountering
    input or output that can't be handled by its protocols (the default
    is to increment a counter and continue).

Other
-----

.. mrjob-opt::
    :config: conf_paths
    :switch: -c, --conf-path, --no-conf
    :type: :ref:`path list <data-type-path-list>`
    :set: no_mrjob_conf
    :default: see :py:func:`~mrjob.conf.find_mrjob_conf`

    List of paths to configuration files. This option cannot be used in
    configuration files, because that would cause a universe-ending causality
    paradox. Use `--no-conf` on the command line or `conf_paths=[]` to force
    mrjob to load no configuration files at all. If no config path flags are
    given, mrjob will look for one in the locations specified in
    :ref:`mrjob.conf`.

    Config path flags can be used multiple times to combine config files, much
    like the **include** config file directive. Using :option:`--no-conf` will
    cause mrjob to ignore all preceding config path flags.

    For example, this line will cause mrjob to combine settings from
    ``left.conf`` and ``right .conf``::

        python my_job.py -c left.conf -c right.conf

    This line will cause mrjob to read no config file at all::

        python my_job.py --no-conf

    This line will cause mrjob to read only ``right.conf``, because
    ``--no-conf`` nullifies ``-c left.conf``::

        python my_job.py -c left.conf --no-conf -c right.conf

.. mrjob-opt::
    :config: job_name
    :switch: --job-name
    :type: :ref:`string <data-type-string>`
    :set: all
    :default: (automatic)

    Specifies the name of the job. If this option is omitted, mrjob assigns
    a name automatically, which is guaranteed to be unique, though not
    necessarily descriptive. Use this option to give the job a user-friendly
    name.

    .. versionadded:: 0.4.3

.. mrjob-opt::
    :config: export_job_name
    :switch: --export-job-name
    :type: boolean
    :set: all
    :default: False

    If this option is specified, the environment variable MRJOB_JOB_NAME is set to the name of this job.

    .. versionadded:: 0.4.3


Options ignored by the inline runner
------------------------------------

These options are ignored because they require a real instance of Hadoop:

* :mrjob-opt:`hadoop_extra_args`
* :py:meth:`hadoop_input_format <mrjob.runner.MRJobRunner.__init__>`
* :py:meth:`hadoop_output_format <mrjob.runner.MRJobRunner.__init__>`,
* :mrjob-opt:`hadoop_streaming_jar`
* :mrjob-opt:`jobconf`
* :mrjob-opt:`partitioner`

These options are ignored because the ``inline`` runner does not invoke the job
as a subprocess or run it in its own directory:

* :mrjob-opt:`cmdenv`
* :mrjob-opt:`python_bin`
* :mrjob-opt:`setup_cmds`
* :mrjob-opt:`setup_scripts`
* :mrjob-opt:`steps_python_bin`
* :mrjob-opt:`upload_archives`
* :mrjob-opt:`upload_files`
