"""A simple example of linking a hadoop jar with a Python step.

This example only works out-of-the-box on EMR; to make it work on Hadoop,
change HADOOP_EXAMPLES_JAR to the (local) path of your hadoop-examples.jar.

This also only works on a single input path/directory, due to limitations
of the example jar.
