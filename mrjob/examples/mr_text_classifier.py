"""A text classifier that uses a modified version of Naive Bayes that is not
sensitive to document length.

This is a somewhat contrived example in that it does everything in one job;
generally you'd run one job to generate n-gram scores, put them in a sqlite
database, and run a second job to score documents. But this is simple, and
it works!

This takes text files as its input. Each file's name should have the format
```unique_id-cat_id_1-cat_id_2-etc.txt```, where ```unique_id``` is unique
for this document, and ```cat_id_1``` etc. are categories the document
is known to belong to. You may also use the form ```not_cat_id_3``` to
indicate that a document is known *not* to belong to ```cat_id_3```. Document
and category IDs may not contain the ```-``` or ```.``` characters. For
examples, look in ```docs-to-classify/```.

This job outputs the documents, with the field 'cat_to_score' filled in.
Generally, positive scores indicate the document is in the category, and
negative scores indicate it is not, but it's up to you to determine a
threshold for each category. This job also outputs scores for each ngram,
so that you can classify other documents.

About half of the documents are placed in a test set (based on SHA1 hash of
their text), which means they will not be used to train the classifier. The
'in_test_set' of each document will be filled accordingly. You can turn
this off with the --no-test-set flag. (You can also effectively put docs
in the training set by specifying no category information.)

Some terminology:

An "ngram" is a word or phrase. "foo" is a 1-gram; "foo bar baz" is a 3-gram.

"tf" refers to term frequency, that is, the number of times an ngram appears.
"df" refers to document frequency, that is, the number of documents an ngram
appears in at least once.

        add it to the document. Also pass ngram scores through as-is.

        To score a document, we essentially take a weighted average of all
        the scores for ngrams of each size, and then sum together those
        averages. ngrams that aren't scored (because they're very rare or
        very common) are considered to have a score of zero. Using averages
        allows us to be insensitive to document size. There is a penalty
        for very small documents.
