"""Utilities for dealing with AWS IAM.

The main purpose of this code is to create the needed IAM instance profiles,
roles, and policies to make EMR work with a new account.

This works somewhat similarly to the AWS CLI (aws emr create-default-roles),
except they are assigned random mrjob-* names.

There isn't really versioning; mrjob will simply check if there are IAM objects
idential to the ones it needs before attempting to create them.
