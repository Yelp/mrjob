class MRJobRunner(object):
    """Abstract base class for all runners.

    Runners are responsible for launching your job on Hadoop Streaming and
    fetching the results.

    Most of the time, you won't have any reason to construct a runner directly;
    it's more like a utility that allows an :py:class:`~mrjob.job.MRJob`
    to run itself. Normally things work something like this:

    - Get a runner by calling :py:meth:`~mrjob.job.MRJob.make_runner` on your job
    - Call :py:meth:`~mrjob.runner.MRJobRunner.run` on your runner. This will:
 
      - Run your job with :option:`--steps` to find out how many mappers/reducers to run
      - Copy your job and supporting files to Hadoop
      - Instruct Hadoop to run your job with the appropriate :option:`--mapper`, :option:`--reducer`, and :option:`--step-num` arguments

    Each runner runs a single job once; if you want to run a job multiple
    times, make multiple runners.

    Subclasses: :py:class:`~mrjob.local.LocalMRJobRunner`, 
    :py:class:`~mrjob.emr.EMRJobRunner`,
    :py:class:`~mrjob.hadoop.HadoopJobRunner`
    """

    #: alias for this runner; used for picking section of
    #: :py:mod:``mrjob.conf`` to load one of ``'local'``, ``'emr'``,
    #: or ``'hadoop'``
    alias = None

    ### methods to call from your batch script ###

    def __init__(self, mr_job_script=None, conf_path=None,
                 extra_args=None, file_upload_args=None,
                 input_paths=None, output_dir=None, stdin=None,
                 **opts):
        """All runners take the following keyword arguments:
        
        :type mr_job_script: str
        :param mr_job_script: the path of the ``.py`` file containing the :py:class:`~mrjob.job.MRJob`. If this is None, you won't actually be able to :py:meth:`run` the job, but other utilities (e.g. :py:meth:`ls`) will work.
        :type conf_path: str
        :param conf_path: Alternate path to read configs from, or ``False`` to ignore all config files.
        :type extra_args: list of str
        :param extra_args: a list of extra cmd-line arguments to pass to the mr_job script. For example: ``['--protocol', 'repr']``. This is a hook to allow jobs to take additional arguments.
        :param file_upload_args: a list of tuples of ``('--ARGNAME', path)``. The file at the given path will be uploaded to the local directory of the mr_job script when it runs, and then passed into the script with ``--ARGNAME``. Useful for passing in SQLite DBs and other configuration files to your job.
        :type input_paths: list of str
        :param input_paths: Input files for your job. Supports globs and recursively walks directories (e.g. ``['data/common/', 'data/training/*.gz']``). If this is left blank, we'll read from stdin
        :type output_dir: str
        :param output_dir: an empty/non-existent directory where Hadoop streaming should put the final output from the job. If you don't specify an output directory, we'll output into a subdirectory of this job's temporary directory. You can control this from the command line with ``--output-dir``.
        :param stdin: an iterable (can be a ``StringIO`` or even a list) to use as stdin. This is a hook for testing; if you set ``stdin`` via :py:meth:`~mrjob.job.MRJob.sandbox`, it'll get passed through to the runner. If for some reason your lines are missing newlines, we'll add them; this makes it easier to write automated tests.

        All runners also take the following options as keyword arguments.
        These can be defaulted in your :mod:`mrjob.conf` file:
        
        :type base_tmp_dir: str
        :param base_tmp_dir: path to put local temp dirs inside
        :type bootstrap_mrjob: bool
        :param bootstrap_mrjob: should we automatically tar up the mrjob library and install it when we run the mrjob? Set this to ``False`` if you've already installed ``mrjob`` on your Hadoop cluster.
        :type cleanup: str
        :param cleanup: is :py:meth:`cleanup` allowed to clean up logs and scratch files? See :py:data:`CLEANUP_CHOICES`.
        :type cmdenv: dict
        :param cmdenv: environment variables to pass to the job inside Hadoop streaming
        :type hadoop_extra_args: list of str
        :param hadoop_extra_args: extra arguments to pass to hadoop streaming
        :type jobconf: dict
        :param jobconf: ``-jobconf`` args to pass to hadoop streaming. This should be a map from property name to value. Equivalent to passing ``['-jobconf', 'KEY1=VALUE1', '-jobconf', 'KEY2=VALUE2', ...]`` to ``hadoop_extra_args``.
        :type job_name_prefix: str
        :param job_name_prefix: description of this job to use as part of its name (by default, we infer a prefix from the name of the mrjob script)
        :type python_archives: list of str
        :param python_archives: same as upload_archives, except they get added to the job's :envvar:`$PYTHONPATH`
        :type setup_cmds: list
        :param setup_cmds: a list of commands to run before each mapper/reducer step (e.g. ``['cd my-src-tree; make', 'mkdir -p /tmp/foo']``). You can specify commands as strings, which will be run through the shell, or lists of args, which will be invoked directly. We'll use file locking to ensure that multiple mappers/reducers running on the same node won't run *setup_cmds* simultaneously (it's safe to run ``make``).
        :type setup_scripts: list of str
        :param setup_scripts: files that will be copied into the local working directory and then run. These are run after *setup_cmds*. Like with *setup_cmds*, we use file locking to keep multiple mappers/reducers on the same node from running *setup_scripts* simultaneously.
        :type upload_archives: list of str
        :param upload_archives: a list of archives (e.g. tarballs) to unpack in the local directory of the mr_job script when it runs. You can set the local name of the dir we unpack into by appending ``#localname`` to the path; otherwise we just use the name of the archive file (e.g. ``foo.tar.gz``)
        :type upload_files: list of str
        :param upload_files: a list of files to copy to the local directory of the mr_job script when it runs. You can set the local name of the dir we unpack into by appending ``#localname`` to the path; otherwise we just use the name of the file
