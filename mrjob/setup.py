"""Utilities for setting up the environment jobs run in by uploading files
and running setup scripts.

The general idea is to use Hadoop DistributedCache-like syntax to find and
parse expressions like ``/path/to/file#name_in_working_dir`` into "path
dictionaries" like
``{'type': 'file', 'path': '/path/to/file', 'name': 'name_in_working_dir'}}``.

You can then pass these into a :py:class:`WorkingDirManager` to keep
track of which files need to be uploaded, catch name collisions, and assign
names to unnamed paths (e.g. ``/path/to/file#``). Note that
:py:meth:`WorkingDirManager.name` can take a path dictionary as keyword
arguments.

If you need to upload files from the local filesystem to a place where
Hadoop can see them (HDFS or S3), we provide :py:class:`UploadDirManager`.

Path dictionaries are meant to be immutable; all state is handled by
manager classes.

    """Parse a setup/bootstrap command, finding and pulling out Hadoop
    Distributed Cache-style paths ("hash paths").

    :param string cmd: shell command to parse
    :return: a list containing dictionaries (parsed hash paths) and strings
             (parts of the original command, left unparsed)

    Hash paths look like ``path#name``, where *path* is either a local path
    or a URI pointing to something we want to upload to Hadoop/EMR, and *name*
    is the name we want it to have when we upload it; *name* is optional
    (no name means to pick a unique one).

    If *name* is followed by a trailing slash, that indicates *path* is an
    archive (e.g. a tarball), and should be unarchived into a directory on the
    remote system. The trailing slash will *also* be kept as part of the
    original command.

    Parsed hash paths are dicitionaries with the keys ``path``, ``name``, and
    ``type`` (either ``'file'`` or ``'archive'``).

    Most of the time, this function will just do what you expect. Rules for
    finding hash paths:

    * we only look for hash paths outside of quoted strings
    * *path* may not contain quotes or whitespace
    * *path* may not contain `:` or `=` unless it is a URI (starts with
      ``<scheme>://``); this allows you to do stuff like
      ``export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:foo.egg#``.
    * *name* may not contain whitespace or any of the following characters:
      ``'":;><|=/#``, so you can do stuff like
      ``sudo dpkg -i fooify.deb#; fooify bar``

    If you really want to include forbidden characters, you may use backslash
    escape sequences in *path* and *name*. (We can't guarantee Hadoop/EMR
    will accept them though!). Also, remember that shell syntax allows you
    to concatenate strings ``like""this``.

    Environment variables and ``~`` (home dir) in *path* will be resolved
    (use backslash escapes to stop this). We don't resolve *name* because it
    doesn't make sense. Environment variables and ``~`` elsewhere in the
    command are considered to be part of the script and will be resolved
    on the remote system.
